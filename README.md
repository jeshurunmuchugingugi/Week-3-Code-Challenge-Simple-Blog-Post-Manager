# üìù Simple Blog Post Manager

A JavaScript-powered blog post manager that allows users to **create**, **edit**, **view**, and **delete** blog entries. It works with a mock backend API (such as [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)) and dynamically updates the page content without reloading.

## üöÄ Features

* **Add New Blog Post**
* **Display List of Blog Posts**
* **View a Single Blog Post**
* **Edit an Existing Blog Post**
* **Delete a Blog Post**
* Automatically truncates post content longer than 150 characters.
* Posts include title, author, date, image, and content.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**
* **JSON Server** (for simulating a backend API)

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

This script connects to the following HTML elements:

* `#post-form`: Form for submitting new posts.
* `#post-title`, `#author-name`, `#image-url`, `#post-content`: Input fields.
* `#blog-identity`: Sidebar showing blog post titles and metadata.
* `#blog-content-container`: Main content area displaying post content.

---

## üì¶ Post Format

Each blog post is an object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "My Blog Title",
  "author": "John Doe",
  "date": "2025-06-24",
  "image": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "content": "This is the blog post content..."
}
```

---

## üñ•Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Submit Form**:

   * If `editPostId` is set, it updates the post using `PATCH`.
   * Otherwise, it creates a new post with `POST`.

2. **Display Posts**:

   * Posts are fetched from `http://localhost:3000/posts`.
   * Each post is shown in both a sidebar and main content area.
   * Content over 150 characters is truncated to 250 characters and shown with ellipses.

3. **View Single Post**:

   * Clicking a post in the sidebar shows it alone in the main area.

4. **Edit Post**:

   * Fills the form with post data and sets `editPostId`.

5. **Delete Post**:

   * Prompts for confirmation and sends a `DELETE` request.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Install JSON Server** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   npm install -g json-server
   ```

2. **Create a `db.json` file**:

   ```json
   {
     "posts": []
   }
   ```

3. **Start JSON Server**:

   ```bash
   json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
   ```

4. **Open your HTML file** in a browser and interact with the blog UI.

## üìå Notes

* Ensure the input elements in your HTML have the correct IDs (`post-title`, `author-name`, etc.).
* Ensure the submit button has the ID `submit-button` to reflect label changes (e.g., "Update Post").
* The script auto-refreshes posts on load and after any action (create, update, delete).

---

## ‚úÖ To-Do (Optional Enhancements)

* Add client-side form validation
* Include pagination or search
* Show success/error messages
* Add tags or categories to posts
