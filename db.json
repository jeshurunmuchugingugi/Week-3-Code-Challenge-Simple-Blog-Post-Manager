Through his work in painting and sculpture, Da Vinci became a master of the realistic representation of the human figure and the use of chiaroscuro to create depth and drama in his works.\n\nBut Da Vinci was not limited to painting and sculpture. He was also a highly prolific inventor and scientist, with interests ranging from anatomy and mechanics to botany and geology. His insatiable curiosity led him to study a wide range of subjects, and many of his sketches and notes contain ideas that were far ahead of their time.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci, one of the most famous and influential artists in history, was born in Vinci, Italy, in 1452.
